3. School System - ***constantly updated*** <br>
A project that shows how a school system works. The complete system should include a website as well as a portal. The website advertises the school to external audiences while the portal serves the purpose of registering all school members including the staff and students. All members should be able to view and update their details through their user interface. <br>
The features in this project are gradually updated, with only the website section currently complete.
<br><br>

I have deployed this system using both Django and WordPress.<br>
